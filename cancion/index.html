    <h4 align="center">Letra de cancion</h4>
    
    <p align="center">I put in a lotta time here 
    <br>So I recorded a warnin' for ya
    <br> got to night five here</br>
    <br>But I got more to the story, lore dump</br>
    <br>Careful, the killer's in the buildin' now</br>
    <br>Did you get all the unattended children out?</br>
    <br>We play hard on the graveyard</br>
    <br>But once you're in, no gettin' out</p></br>
    <p align="center">Oh, so you workin' security?
    <br>Intruder alerts are surely a certainty
    <br>Including the curse of work insecurity
    <br>When your imposter syndrome ends up turning you purpley</br>
    <br>Pull up your monitors, toggle between
    <br>Even if somethin' on 'em is jumpin' off of the screen
    <br>The party's poppin' off, everybody's startin' to scream
    <br>If you keep up with the monsters, you can follow your dreams</br>
    <br>So you picked up the job, now don't drop your guard</br>
    <br>'Cause the pizza's not hot, but the demons are
    <br>Started from the ball-pit, no apologies
    <br>If I get nostalgic for all things (Woo!), Chuck E. Cheese</br>
    <br>The first animatronic to serenade me with song
    <br>And ever since, it's like I never stopped singin' along
    <br>Stuck in a circular circus, it's an eternal loop now</br>
    <br>Every remnant of any family fun was scooped out</br>
    <br>Now my gears have gone dull 'cause I'm hard on my grind
    <br>Started with the night-shift, now I'm pullin' fulltime
    <br>I got Freddy in my veins, it ain't Mercury</br>
    <br>We lost all the magic behind the curtain, see?</br>
    <br>I am inactive when I'm under the lights 
    <br>(Lights)
    <br>Because the magic only happens at night 
    <br>(Tonight)
    <br>'m sick of singin' songs I wouldn't write
    <br> think I thought that this job would not actually bite
    <br>'Cause I was—</p></br>
    <p align="center">Bad night, but that was last night
    <br> the next night, na-na-na-na-na
    <br>Another bad night, but you'll come back, right?
    <br>Until the last night, na-na-na-na-na-na </p></br>
    <p align="center">Late nights are fine by me
    <br> the daylight, I hide my teeth
    <br>When I play nice, you might not see this comin'
    <br>'Cause I'll be back for another bite</p></br>
    <p align="center">What do you need a clock for? 
    <br>(What do you need a lock for?)
    <br> outta time, who wants more? 
    <br>(The audience!)</p></br>
    <p align="center"><br>Knockin' upon your door, what do they hunger for?
    <br>Give 'em the essence of creation 
    <br>(At its core)
    <br>Hi, kids, if you like violence
    <br>Look into my eyes, soon, you'll see from inside them 
    <br>(Yay!)
    <br>You should never judge any Endoskeleton by his cover
    <br>When all his wires are tangled, just work on findin' the gutters
    <br>Because when I come to life, you'd be wise to hide
    <br>Keep an eye on the time and a light by your side
    <br>You can try, if you'd like, to survive every night
    <br>Take my hand, don't be shy, need a friend, phone a guy
    <br>(Yeah, uh, ha)</p></br>
    <p align="center">Minimum wage ain't great, but ya never knew 
    <br>(Where you'll go)
    <br>'Cause you can take a day-job like a steppin' stone
    <br>Would you prefer a Springtrap to a pigeonhole
    <br>Now you're a one-trick pony, but you're not alone
    <br>No wonder why you keep comin' back 
    <br>(Comin' back)
    <br>Playin' out the tape just so you could run it back 
    <br>(Run it back)
    <br>Over and over again until there was nothin' left 
    <br>(Nothin' left)
    <br>Tryin' to find the answers you're never gonna get
    <br>(Because I was—)</p></br>
    <p align="center">Another bad night, but that was last night
    <br>Onto the next night, na-na-na-na-na
    <br>Another bad night, but you'll come back, right?
    <br>Until the last night, na-na-na-na-na-na</p><b/br>
    <p align="center">Late nights are fine by me
    <br>In the daylight, I hide my teeth
    <br>When I play nice, you might not see this comin'</br>
    <br>'Cause I'll be back for another bite</p></br>
    <p align="center">I've punched my card, nine-to-five can be real slow
    <br>Lights off, doors locked, now you're getting a real show
    <br> would wanna work a day-job? Not me
    <br>You ain't gettin' off the graveyard scot-free
    <br>Job description didn't say I would make it
    <br>Nor did I fit the position, but I decided to take it
    <br>So fake it—</p></br>
    
    <p align="center">Bad night, but that was last night
    <br>Onto the next night, na-na-na-na-na
    <br>Another bad night, but you'll come back, right?
    <br>Until the last night, na-na-na-na-na-na</p></br> 
    
    <p align="center"> Nights are fine by me
    <br> the daylight, I hide my teeth
    <br> I play nice, you might not see this comin'
    <br>'Cause I'll be back for another bite</p></br>
    
    <p align="center">You wanna wear my skin?
        <br>Go on and step right in
        <br>You wanna wear my skin?
        <br>Go on and step right i—
        <br>(On, and on, and on, and on, away)
        <br>(I mean, on, and on, and on, and on, away)
        <br>(I mean, on, and on, and on, and on, away)
        <br>(I mea—)
        <br>Who is comin' back for another bite?</p></br>
